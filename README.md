# reddy
c++ sfml game that is pretty pogger but has garbage graphics because i literally cannot draw

## why program no runny???

you need to create a `settings.ini` in the root directory of the project

sample `settings.ini`:
```ini
reddy
800 600
120
0
```
1. application name
2. width height
3. fps
4. vsync enabled? (true=1|false=0)
